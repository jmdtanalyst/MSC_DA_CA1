# MSC_DA_CA1 - Exploring the Link Between Population Trends and Renting Prices

Population in Ireland X Cost of Renting

This repository contains code and data for a project to model and analyze the population of Ireland and Renting Prices. The project uses data from the following sources:
* Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland, which is available at https://data.cso.ie/ 
* IRELAND'S OPEN DATA PORTAL, which is available at https://data.gov.ie.
* 
The aim of this project is to explore the link between population trends and renting prices in Ireland. To achieve this goal, I will investigate how population growth, immigration, migration, and other population factors affect the cost of renting a home in Ireland.

Understanding the link between population trends and renting prices will help the government to make policy decisions to help people and to develop policies that increase the supply of affordable housing or provide financial assistance to renters who are struggling to afford their rent.

The project is focused on the following areas of interest:

    How has the population of Ireland changed in recent years?
    How have renting prices changed in recent years?
    Relationship between population growth and renting prices in Ireland
    Population trends can be used to predict future rent prices in Ireland.

    
A variety of statistical methods will be used to analyze it. For example, you could use regression analysis to model the relationship between population growth and renting prices. You could also use forecasting methods to predict future rent prices based on population trends.
